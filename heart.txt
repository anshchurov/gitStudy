See the reich in flames
Try to save Hell in vain
It's a road through death and pain
On the other shore there's the end of the war


Who could ever have believed seems like nothing's been achieved
Just to walk a day go all the way the fronts are closing in
As the end is drawing near the 12:th army interfere
Open up a route get people out its forces spread out thin

It's the end of the war
